## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
**My Tuition (FSI)** is a mobile-first, AI-powered tuition management platform designed to automate administrative tasks, eliminate manual communication overhead, and deliver custom, hyper-personalized AI tutors and helpers for all education stakeholders.

Unlike traditional, rigid educational CRMs, **My Tuition (FSI)** places Artificial Intelligence at the very core of its design. The platform implements a highly optimized, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) workspace tailored for four distinct user roles: **Administrators**, **Teachers**, **Students**, and **Parents**. By doing so, it serves as the central operations terminal and educational copilot for tuition centers.

## 5. Mobile Accessibility & UX/UI Principles
To overcome screen constraints and text clipping common in complex enterprise applications, the following UX principles are enforced:
1. **Scrollable Tab Rows:** All high-density navigators use `ScrollableTabRow` instead of rigid `TabRow` to guarantee text remains fully readable and doesn't squish on compact devices.
2. **Horizontal Pill-Bars:** Interactive switcher panels (e.g., role switchers) use bounded horizontally-scrolling lists with generous padding.
3. **Adaptive Component Sizing:** Elements use dynamic vertical padding rather than hardcoded pixel/DP heights, preventing layout spillovers.
4. **Touch Target Standards:** Maintain interactive elements at a minimum of `48.dp` x `48.dp` with Material Ripples for tactile responsive feedback.
5. **System Inset Handling:** Use of `navigationBarsPadding()` on structural panels to prevent screen content from leaking underneath the Android navigation pill.
